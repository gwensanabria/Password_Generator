# Password_Generator
HW 3

Started with functions. console.log to check that they returned numbers.
Then pulled elements from the HTML.
Checked that the variables would be validated when checked.
Failed to get random password returned.

BUT I LEARNED A WAY TO TURN THE ALPHABET INTO A STRING WITHOUT PUTTING EACH LETTER IN QUOTATIONS.
